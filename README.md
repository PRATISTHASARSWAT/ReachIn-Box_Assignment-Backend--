PROJECT OVERVIEW

The objective of this initiative is to establish OAuth integration with Google and Microsoft platforms to obtain authorization for accessing user email accounts. Following email retrieval, the system will employ OpenAI to analyze the content and classify emails into three distinct categories: 'Interested', 'Not Interested', and 'Requesting More Information'. Subsequently, automated email responses will be generated based on these classifications, by creating our own model using Python, than traning that model through dataset than further testing it.
